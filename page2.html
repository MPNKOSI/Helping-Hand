    Helping Hand
    
        This is a simple HTML page.
    
        I won't teach how VS Code works however I will help with how HTML work.
        Let's start.
    

    What is HTML?

    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages.
    It tells the browser:
    What content to display

    How content is structured

    What is a heading, paragraph, image, link, button, etc.

    HTML is the foundation of every website.

    How HTML Works (Big Picture)

When you visit a website:

The browser downloads an HTML file
It reads the tags
It builds the page structure
CSS styles it
JavaScript makes it interactive
Think of it like this:
HTML = Structure (Skeleton)
CSS = Design (Clothes)
JavaScript = Behavior (Brain)

Let's see how HTML looks like if it not structured.

Click the button

    <a href="/page2.html">Button</a>

    <div>
        <h1>Let Use CSS & JavaScript</h1>
        <p></p>
        <a href="/page3.html">Click Here</a>
    </div>
</body>
